function est=parameterEstimate(W,dt)
% est=parameterEstimate(W)
% Estimate some model properties
%
% W     : converge HMM model struct
% dt    : time step of the data (default: 1)

% est   : parameter struct with fields
%             D: diffusion constant
%        lambda: 2*D*dt
%            p0: initial state probability
%          pOcc: total occupancy (from variational state distribution)
%           pSS: steady state of the transition matrix A
%             A: transition matrix
%    dwellSteps: mean dwell time in units of time step
%     dwellTime: mean dwell times in units of time
