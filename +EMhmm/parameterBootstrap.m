% Parameter bootstrap 
%
% W     : input HMM model (recommend converged model)
% dat   : data to resample
% Nbs   : number of bootstrap resamples
% dt    : time step for parameter estimate (optional: default 1);
%
% BS    : bootstrap struct with bootstrap parameter estiamtes. Last index
%         is the bootstrap iteration. See EMhmm.parameterEstimate for the
%         meaning of the fields.
% ind   : bootstrap indices, one permutation per row.
