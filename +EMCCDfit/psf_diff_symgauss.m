% [E,dE_dmuX,dE_dmuY,dE_dlnB,dE_dlnN,dE_dlnS]=psf_diff_psfGaussian(xx,yy,p)
%
% symmetric Gaussian PSF model and partial derivatives, parameterized by
% p=[ muX muY lnB lnN lnS] :
% E = exp(lnB) + f, with 
% f = N/2/pi/S^2*exp(-0.5*((xx-muX)/S)^2-0.5*((yy-muY)/S)^2)
%
% Note that this is a continuous model, so that exp(lnB) is the background
% intensity per unit area, not per pixel. But when doing math in pixel
% units the area per pixel is 1, and then this does not matter.
