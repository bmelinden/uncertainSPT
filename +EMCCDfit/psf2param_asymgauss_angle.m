function param=psf2param_asymgauss_angle(p,param)
% param=psf2param_asymgauss_angle(p,param)
% asymmetric Gaussian PSF model and partial derivatives, 
% parameterized by parameters
% p=[ muX muY lnB lnN lnS1 lnS2 v] :
% E = exp(lnB) + f, with 
% f = N/2/pi/S1/S2*exp(-0.5*( cos(v)*(xx-muX)+sin(v)*(yy-muY))^2/S1^2
%                      -0.5*(-sin(v)*(xx-muX)+cos(v)*(yy-muY))^2/S2^2)
%
% Note that this is a continuous model, so that exp(lnB) is the background
% intensity per unit area, not per pixel. But when doing math in pixel
% units the area per pixel is 1, and then this does not matter.
%
% param : input struct (optional). If given, existing fields are modofied
% (or not) accoridng to the output.
%
% output: parameter struct p, with fields
% p.background  : background intensity photons/area = exp(lnB)
% p.amplitude   : spot amplitude (photons)          = exp(lnN)
% p.std1        : spot principal width 1, standard deviation   = exp(lnS1)
% p.std2        : spot principal width 2, standard deviation   = exp(lnS2)
% p.angle       : spot orientation, = v
