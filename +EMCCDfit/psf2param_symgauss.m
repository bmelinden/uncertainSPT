function param=psf2param_symgauss(p,param)
% param=psf2param_symgauss(p,param)
%
% Convert psf fit parameters to parameter struct, using a symmetric
% Gaussian PSF model, parameterized by 
% p=[ muX muY lnB lnN lnS] :
% E = exp(lnB) + f, with 
% f = N/2/pi/S^2*exp(-0.5*((xx-muX)/S)^2-0.5*((yy-muY)/S)^2)
%
% Note that this is a continuous model, so that exp(lnB) is the background
% intensity per unit area, not per pixel. But when doing math in pixel
% units the area per pixel is 1, and then this does not matter.
%
% param : input struct (optional). If given, existing fields are modofied
% (or not) accoridng to the output.
%
% output: parameter struct p, with fields
% p.background  : background intensity photons/area = exp(lnB)
% p.amplitude   : spot amplitude (photons)          = exp(lnN)
% p.std         : spot width, stdandard deviation   = exp(lnS)
